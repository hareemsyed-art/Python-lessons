X_train = the "questions" (age + pocket money) for the first ~70–80 kids
→ This is what the computer studies / looks at while learning
y_train (little y = answers) = the real number of candies those same 70–80 kids actually ate
→ This is the correct answer sheet the computer uses to check if its guesses are getting better during practice
X_test = the "questions" (age + pocket money) for the remaining ~20–30 kids
→ These are kept secret during learning — the computer never sees these questions or answers while studying
y_test = the real number of candies those last 20–30 kids actually ate
→ This is the surprise final exam! After the computer finishes learning, we give it only the X_test questions and see how close its guesses are to the real y_test answers.
